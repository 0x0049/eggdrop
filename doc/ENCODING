                         Encoding support


  This document provides information about the encoding settings which are new
  in eggdrop since version 1.8.0.

  !! Warning: DO NOT use Tcl's [encoding system] command to change the encoding
  !!    ALWAYS use set out-encoding instead, it does encoding system for you.
  !!    See section 3 for details.

  1. General overview

    Eggdrop now performs a low-level encoding conversion on everything that
    it reads from sockets or files, and everything that it outputs to sockets
    or files.
    That includes: the server connection, botnet connections, dcc chat or
    telnet connections, logfiles, the config file, listen sockets.
    The following sections describe how it works in detail and explain the
    new settings (fallback-encoding, out-encoding) associated with it.

  2. Quick settings guide

    If you want your Eggdrop to use UTF-8 for everything (recommended):
      set out-encoding "utf-8".
    You may set fallback-encoding to something other people use in your
    channels to make Eggdrop work with it, e.g.
      set fallback-encoding "cp1251" or "iso8859-1".
    This is only necessary if those users exist.

    If you want your Eggdrop to use a single-byte encoding:
      set out-encoding "iso8859-1".
    You do not need to set fallback-encoding, the out-encoding is
    used automatically to decode as well.

    You can use "iconv -l" on your shell to get a list of supported encodings.

  3. Incoming encoding conversion and fallback-encoding setting

    Eggdrop now attempts to convert any incoming text in this order:
      UTF-8 -> out-encoding -> fallback-encoding -> ISO8859-1.
    If one conversion fails, it moves on to the next until one succeeds.
    Be advised that single-byte encodings never fail, so ISO8859-1 succeeds
    in any case. And if out-encoding or fallback-encoding are single-byte
    encodings, they will succeed before it.

    A list of valid fallback-encoding values can be obtained via the
      iconv -l
    shell command.

  4. Outgoing encoding conversion

    For all outgoing data (the server, partyline connections, logfiles),
    Eggdrop converts it to the user-specified out-encoding.
    If it is not specified, it defaults to the system encoding (LC_ALL).
    This parsing and setting is performed by Tcl.

    The out-encoding setting also calls Tcl's [encoding system] to set
    Tcl's main encoding.

    WARNING: DO NOT MANUALLY CALL [encoding system <encoding>].
    Eggdrop will NOT be able to react to it!
    The reason is that it would be too expensive to trace this.

    A list of valid out-encoding values cab be obtained via the
      echo 'encoding names' | tclsh
    shell command.

  5. Scripts

    The configfile is read using the system encoding.
    The out-encoding variable is not set before starting to read it.
    If the out-encoding variable is set during loading the config,
    scripts are loaded with the new encoding.

    As of Tcl8.5 you can manually specify an encoding to load scripts with:
      source -encoding iso8859-1 scripts/foobar.tcl
