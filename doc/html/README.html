<h2>What is Eggdrop?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-eggdrop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Eggdrop is the World&#8217;s most popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot; it is
freely distributable under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Eggdrop
is a feature rich program designed to be easily used and expanded upon by
both novice and advanced IRC users on a variety of hardware and software
platforms.</p>
<p>An IRC bot is a program that sits on an IRC channel and performs automated
tasks while looking just like a normal user on the channel. Some of these
functions include protecting the channel from abuse, allowing privileged
users to gain op or voice status, logging channel events, providing
information, hosting games, etc.</p>
<p>One of the features that makes Eggdrop stand out from other bots is module
and Tcl scripting support. With scripts and modules, you can make the bot
perform almost any task you want. They can do anything from preventing
floods to greeting users and banning advertisers from channels.</p>
<p>You can also link multiple Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet. This
can allow bots to op each other securely, control floods efficiently, and
even link channels across multiple IRC networks. It also allows the
Eggdrops share user lists, ban lists, exempt/invite lists, and ignore
lists with other bots if userfile sharing is enabled. This allows users
to have the same access on every bot on your botnet. It also allows the
bots to distribute tasks such as opping and banning users. See doc/BOTNET
for information on setting up a botnet.</p>
<p>Eggdrop is always being improved and adjusted because there are bugs to
be fixed and features to be added (if the users demand them, and they make
actually sense). In fact, it existed for several years as v0.7 - v0.9
before finally going 1.0. This version of Eggdrop is part of the 1.8 tree.
A valiant effort has been made to chase down and destroy bugs.</p>
<p>This README file contains information about how to get Eggdrop, command
line options for Eggdrop, what you may need to do when upgrading from
older versions, a list of frequently asked questions, how to set up a
crontab, some boring legal stuff, info about the mailing list (a great
place to ask questions, and a good place to report bugs, too), some basics
about CVS usage, and some channels where you might get help with Eggdrop.</p>

<h2>HOW TO GET EGGDROP<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-eggdrop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before you can compile Eggdrop, you need to have Tcl installed on your
system. Most systems should have Tcl on them by now &#8211; you can check by
trying the command &#8220;tclsh&#8221;. If it works, you will be given a &#8220;%&#8221; prompt,
and you can type &#8220;exit&#8221; to exit the program. This means Tcl is installed
on your system. If tclsh doesn&#8217;t load, then Tcl probably isn&#8217;t on your
system, and you will need to install it. The best ftp site for Tcl is
<a class="reference external" href="ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/">ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the 1.8 tree of Eggdrop is developed at eggheads.org. You can
get the latest STABLE version of Eggdrop from the following url:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a class="reference external" href="http://geteggdrop.com/">http://geteggdrop.com/</a></div></blockquote>
<p>You might try www.eggheads.org for help and information.</p>

<div class="section" id="git-usage">
<h2>Git Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#git-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Eggdrop development has moved from a CVS-based version control system to
git. If you are interested in trying out the VERY LATEST updates to
eggdrop, you may want be interested in pulling the most recent code from
there. BE WARNED, the development branch of Eggdrop is not to be
considered stable, and may (haha) have some significant bugs in it. The
Eggheads Development Team will in NO WAY take any responsibility for
whatever might happen to you or your shell if you use the development
branch of Eggdrop!</p>
<p>To obtain Eggdrop via the git repository (hosted by GitHub), you can
either clone the repository via git, or download a development snapshot.</p>
<p>To clone the repository, simply type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git clone https://github.com/eggheads/eggdrop.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Otherwise, you can download the development snapshot as a tar archive
from:</p>

<h2>Upgrading<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>UPGRADING FROM A PRE-1.3 VERSION TO 1.8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>First of all- why are you still running pre-1.3?!?!</p>
<p>#### BACK UP YOUR USERFILE ####</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t stress this enough. If you are upgrading and you have even a
slight possibility of downgrading again later, you will HAVE to back up
your userfile, or you will lose it. v1.3 of Eggdrop radically changed a
lot of things.</p>
<p>There are many major changes between v0.9, v1.0, v1.1 and v1.8, so PAY
ATTENTION to this part if you have a v0.9, 1.0 or 1.1 bot currently. If
you&#8217;re just starting out, you can skip this section.</p>
<p>If you run share bots, you will need to upgrade them all at the same time
because of the new userfile format. Older bots will be able to link in,
but will not get or send a userfile. MAKE A NEW CONFIG FILE from the
example; there are some radical changes.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from 0.9/1.0 to 1.8, just redo the whole thing.
Absolutely everything has changed, including the userfile and config file
formats.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from 1.1/1.2 to 1.8, you will likely want to redo
the config file, as much as changed. BACK UP! You will need to run &#8216;tclsh
scripts/weed/&lt;userfile&gt; c&#8217; to convert your userfile from v3 (1.1/1.2) to
v4 (1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6/1.8).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER 1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6 VERSION TO A NEWER 1.8 VERSION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you followed the &#8216;INSTALL&#8217; file and did a &#8216;make install&#8217; (or &#8216;make
install DEST=&#8221;path&#8221;&#8217;) after &#8216;make&#8217;, this will be pretty easy. Just upload
the new eggdrop1.8.x.tar.gz file to your home dir on your shell, gunzip
and untar it, and type &#8216;cd ~/eggdrop1.8.x&#8217;. Next, type &#8216;./configure&#8217;,
&#8216;make config&#8217; or &#8216;make iconfig&#8217;, then &#8216;make&#8217;. Then, kill the bot (&#8216;.die&#8217;
on the party line), and &#8216;make install&#8217; to the same directory your bot
is currently in. After that, you can just restart your bot. You may wish
to delete the old Eggdrop executable and modules as well, especially if
you have limited disk space.</p>
<p>You should read through the new eggdrop.conf file for all of the new
options in Eggdrop 1.8.x. You can copy and paste any of these settings
into you current conf file if you do not want to use the default settings.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line">
<h2>Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Eggdrop has some command-line options &#8211; not many, because most things
should be defined through the config file. However, sometimes you may
want to start up the bot in a different mode, and the command-line
options let you do that. Basically, the command line for Eggdrop is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>% eggdrop [options] [config-file]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The options available are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>-n: Don&#8217;t background. Normally, Eggdrop will move itself into the</dt>
<dd>background when you start it up, meaning you&#8217;ll get another shell
prompt, and you can do other things while the bot is running. With
-n, you won&#8217;t return to the shell prompt until the bot exits (which
won&#8217;t normally happen until it&#8217;s killed). By default, -n will send
all log entries to the console.</dd>
<dt>-nt: Don&#8217;t background, use terminal. This is just like -n, except that</dt>
<dd>instead of seeing log entries, your console will simulate a DCC
chat with the bot.</dd>
<dt>-nc: Don&#8217;t background, show channel info. This is just like -n, except</dt>
<dd>that instead of seeing log entries, every 10 seconds your screen
will clear and you will see the current channel status, sort of
like &#8220;top&#8221;.</dd>
<dt>-m: Create userfile. If you don&#8217;t have a userfile, this will make Eggdrop</dt>
<dd>create one and give owner status to the first person that introduces
himself or herself to it. You&#8217;ll need to do this when you first set
up your bot.</dd>
</dl>
<p>-h: Show help.</p>
<p>-v: Show version info, then quit.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Most people never use any of the options except -m, and you usually only
need to use that once.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<div class="section" id="frequently-asked-questions">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>(a.k.a. Why doesn&#8217;t this thing work?!&#8221;)</p>
<p>WHAT DO I DO IF I GET THE ERROR &#8220;USER FILE NOT FOUND&#8221;?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Run Eggdrop with the &#8220;-m&#8221; option (i.e. &#8220;eggdrop -m eggdrop.conf&#8221;).</li>
<li>Go to IRC and send &#8220;hello&#8221; to your bot (i.e. &#8220;/msg mybot hello&#8221;).</li>
<li>You will become an owner on your bot. You can leave the bot running
(nobody else will become an owner if they say &#8220;hello&#8221;), but in the
future, don&#8217;t use the &#8220;-m&#8221; option when running the bot.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>WHAT THE HECK IS Tcl?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Tcl is a scripting language written by John Ousterhout. It&#8217;s much better
than most &#8220;built-in&#8221; script languages (like the one in ircII) and is
meant to be linked with anything needing a  scripting language, so I
linked it with Eggdrop. The file &#8220;tcl-commands.doc&#8221; in the doc directory
contains a list of additional Tcl commands provided by Eggdrop. There
are also several example scripts in the scripts/ directory, and one in
the doc directory called first_script.txt. Hundreds of scripts floating
around on the ftp/web sites if you like working by example (which is
typically the best way).</div></blockquote>
<p>MY BOT DIES, AND THE LAST ENTRY IN THE LOGFILE IS &#8220;RECEIVED TERMINATE
SIGNAL&#8221;. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, AND CAN I PREVENT IT?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>There&#8217;s nothing you can do to prevent it. It means the system
administrator is killing the Eggdrop process. Most of the time, it&#8217;s an
automatic thing that happens when the system is being rebooted, so it&#8217;s
harmless. If you have a crontab running, the bot will get restarted when
the system is back online. Occasionally, the system administrator will
kill the bot manually. For example, if he/she doesn&#8217;t want bots running
on the system.</div></blockquote>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE SET UP A BOT I DON&#8217;T LIKE. ARE THERE ANY BACKDOORS I CAN
USE TO TAKE THEIR BOT DOWN?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>No, there have never been any backdoors and there never will be, so
please stop asking. Every once in a while, someone finds a way to
exploit a bug in Eggdrop, but we fix these bugs as soon as we find out
about them. If you want to bring down someone else&#8217;s bot, you will not
have my/our help.</div></blockquote>
<p>WHAT ARE MODULES?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Modules are a way of adding extra features to the bot, much like Tcl
scripts, without requiring the bot to be recompiled. See doc/MODULES
for more information.</div></blockquote>
<p>CAN I COMPILE EGGDROP WITHOUT DYNAMIC MODULES?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Yes, you can. If the configure script detects that your system CAN&#8217;T
run modules, it will setup &#8216;make&#8217; to link the modules in statically
for you. You can choose this option yourself by using &#8216;make static&#8217;.
You can also try to compile dynamic modules on a static-only system
by using &#8216;make eggdrop&#8217;.</div></blockquote>
<p>DO I STILL NEED TO &#8216;loadmodule&#8217; MODULES?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>YES, when you compile statically, all the modules are linked into the
main executable. HOWEVER, they are not enabled until you use loadmodule
to enable them, hence you get nearly the same functionality with static
modules as with dynamic modules.</div></blockquote>
<p>WHERE CAN I GET A PRE-COMPILED EGGDROP FOR MY COMPUTER?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It is HIGHLY recommended AGAINST using pre-compiled Eggdrops from
un-trusted sources. Eggdrop has been a regular target for hacking and
crashing. Distribution of pre-compiled (binary) versions of Eggdrop are
the easiest way for hackers to provide you with the easiest (and most
dangerous) way of gaining access to, not only your bot, but to your
computer account directly. Don&#8217;t advertise your pre-compiled Eggdrop
binary sites on the Eggdrop list either. =P</div></blockquote>
<p>I GET &#8216;Makefile:3 :invalid operator&#8217; OR SOME-SUCH-THING WHEN I TRY

generally) and accept the loss of that data.</div></blockquote>

need to recompile your bot.</p>
<p>Maybe, when upgrading, he didn&#8217;t clean the old version of Tcl and
&#8216;./configure&#8217; is looking for the files in the wrong places, or trying

<h2>Setting up a Crontab<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-crontab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Eggdrop has become more stable with time, thanks mostly to people
reporting bug details and helping find places where it crashes. However,
there are still a -few- places where things aren&#8217;t perfect. Few, if any,
things in life are.</p>
<p>Also, most systems go down from time to time. These things cause your bot
to disappear from IRC, and you have to restart it.</p>
<p>Eggdrop comes with a shell script called &#8216;botchk&#8217; that will help keep the
bot online. It will make the machine check every ten minutes to make sure
your bot is still running. To use it, you have to add a line to your
crontab. First, edit &#8216;botchk&#8217; and change the directory and command line
parameters so that it will be able to start up your bot. Then, add this
line to your crontab:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to get e-mails from cron, use this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Naturally, you need to change the path to the correct path for botchk. If
you&#8217;ve never used crontab before, here is a simple way to add that line:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a new file called &#8216;mycron&#8217; and put the above line into it.</li>
<li>From your shell prompt, type &#8216;% crontab mycron&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That will create a new crontab entry for you with a line that runs botchk
every ten minutes. Botchk will then restart the bot when necessary (and
send you email informing you).</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>Setting up a Crontab using autobotchk<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-crontab-using-autobotchk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Included with your Eggdrop is an Eggdrop utility called &#8216;autobotchk&#8217;.
Using autobotchk is probably the fastest way of creating your botchk and
crontabbing it with just a few required steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp scripts/autobotchk ..
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>./autobotchk &lt;Eggdrop config file&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This will hopefully crontab your bot using the default setup. If you want
a list of autobotchk options, type &#8216;./autobotchk&#8217;. An example with options
would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>./autobotchk &lt;Eggdrop config file&gt; -noemail -5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This would setup crontab to run the botchk every 5 minutes and also to
not send you e-mail saying that it restarted your bot.</p>

<div><p>There are currently a couple of mailing lists about Eggdrop.
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:eggheads&#37;&#52;&#48;eggheads&#46;org">eggheads<span>&#64;</span>eggheads<span>&#46;</span>org</a> is the one relevant for posts about Eggdrop 1.8 and
up (suggestions, help, etc).</p>
<p>To subscribe to the eggheads mailing list, send e-mail to

<p>### DO NOT SEND ROBEY EMAIL ABOUT EGGDROP! ###</p>
<p>Robey is no longer developing the Eggdrop code, so don&#8217;t bother e-mailing
him. If you have a serious problem, email the eggheads mailing list and
it will get to the coders.</p>
<p>Please, before posting to this list, see what things are like. When you do
post, read over your post for readability, spelling, and grammar mistakes.
Obviously, we&#8217;re all human (or are we?) and we all make mistakes (heck,
look at this document! ;).</p>
<p>Open discussion and debate is integral to change and progress. Don&#8217;t flame
others over mere form (grammar and spelling), or even substantive issues
for that matter. Please read and follow the mailing list rules.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="mailto:eggheads&#37;&#52;&#48;eggheads&#46;org">eggheads<span>&#64;</span>eggheads<span>&#46;</span>org</a> mailing list is not dedicated to those all too
common questions we have all seen on other lists... For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>o &#8220;Why does my bot say this: Please edit your config file.&#8221;
o &#8220;How do I telnet my bot?&#8221;
o &#8220;Where do I get Eggdrop for windows??????&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>Technical questions, your thoughts or suggestions on new features being
added to Eggdrop, things that should be removed or fixed, amazing problems
that even stump the guru&#8217;s, etc. are what we want to see here.</p>
<p>Bug reports should be sent to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bugs&#37;&#52;&#48;eggheads&#46;org">bugs<span>&#64;</span>eggheads<span>&#46;</span>org</a>. Please read and fill out
the BUG-REPORT file in the doc directory.</p>
<p>DO NOT SEND HTML E-MAILS TO ANY OF THE EGGHEADS.ORG MAILING LISTS. ANYONE
CAUGHT SENDING HTML E-MAILS TO ONE OF THESE LISTS WILL BE REMOVED
IMMEDIATELY!</p>
