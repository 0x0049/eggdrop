Eggdrop 1.8.0
=============

Upgrading from 1.6.x
--------------------

Eggdrop1.8 is fully compatible with Eggdrop1.6 with regards to both 3rd party modules and Tcl scripts.

You SHOULD make a backup of your userfile, chanfile and configfile before upgrading, just in case.

However, because most 3rd party modules include a version check and refuse to work with 1.8.x out of the box,
we are providing adapted versions of the most popular modules at ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/.

Scripts are fully compatible, and benefit from utf-8 support (other encodings than utf-8 and iso8859-1 are
not supported yet, but we are hoping to fully support them in a later version of Eggdrop1.8) and various bug fixes.

You can view a list of changes (in patch form) in the default config on http://eggheads.org/eggconf180.txt,
but the only significant change other than introducing IPv6 configuration variables, is that the my-ip/my-hostname
setting has been split into vhost4, vhost6 and listen-addr. You should set vhost4 and listen-addr to what you had
set my-ip/my-hostname to, and it should work the same.

If you have a botnet, be advised that for botnet links to establish a SSL connection, you need to "make sslcert" after
"make install" to generate a self-signed certificate for the hub bot.

Major Changes
-------------

The biggest changes in Eggdrop1.8 are IPv6 and SSL/TLS support for both IRC connections and the partyline connections.
Please read doc/TLS and doc/IPV6 for details.

The most noticable bug fixes include fixing the "timer bug" (where during execution of a timed Tcl procedure, it might
not always see its own timer), the "onchan bug" (where Eggdrop did not reset the channel list after leaving a channel),
a lot of compilation fixes for various operating systems (including cygwin, see README for how to build Eggdrop on cygwin),
and a change from the supported encoding from iso8859-x to utf-8 (iso8859-x still works).
We are planning support for various other encodings in a later release of Eggdrop1.8.

Eggdrop1.8.0 includes an eggdrop-basic.conf that is installed with "make install", that can be used to configure
a pretty standard Eggdrop with no advanced features. We still recommend reading and using eggdrop.conf to get
full control over the settings of all of Eggdrop's features.
