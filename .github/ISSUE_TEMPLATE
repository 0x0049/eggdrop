4.8 If the bot dumped a 'core' file when it crashed, it would be *very*
     useful if you could paste gdb's output during the following steps:
     First call gdb
         $ gdb eggdrop -c core
     and then enter 'bt' on gdb's command line:
         (gdb) bt
     Keep your core file for at least one week, so that the dev team
     can ask for further information if needed. However, don't send
     us the core file unless we ask for it.

     NOTE: If this is a bug you can reproduce, please compile with
           make debug and follow the above step. It can greatly help
           find and fix the bug.
