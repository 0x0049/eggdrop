Eggdrop v1.9.2:

 General changes:
    - Added CAP 302 support, and generally enhance CAP support
    - Enabled threaded core DNS requests as the default method for DNS lookups;
      this can be disabled with ./configure --disable-tdns
    - Added support for the MONITOR CAP capability, allowing tracking of online
      and offline nicknames
    - Added support for the 005 BOT flag, allowing tracking of users that
      declare themselves as bots to the IRC server
    - Added SSL status to the .bottree command, denoted with a '=' symbol
    - Fixed allowing Eggdrop to process message-tags even if the message-tags
      capability is not explicitly requested
    - Alt-nick is now used before a randomly genreated nickname if the requested
      nickname is rejected as invalid by the server. This feature is now
      divorced of any previous dependence on the keep-nick setting, with the
      reasoning that getting the Eggdrop onto the server with a random nick is
      more important than keeping a nickname and not ever joining, particularly
      from a troubleshooting standpoint
    - RAWT binds returning a '1' now block similar RAW binds from triggering
      by the same activity (but RAW binds cannot block a RAWT bind- use a RAWT!)
    - Fixed mistakenly requiring a flag for the 'listen script' command

  Botnet changes:
    - None

  Tcl API changes:
    - Added the 'monitor' command, which allows interaction with the CAP
      MONITOR capability
    - Added the 'isircbot' command, which returns if a user has registered as a
      bot with the IRC server
    - Added the 'server list' command, which lists servers added to Eggdrop
    - Added the USERNOTICE bind to the Twitch module
    - Added a 'values' argument to the 'cap' command, outputting the display of
      CAP 302 values, if any, associated with each capability

  Module changes:
    - None

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - Added 'extended-join' setting, to enable the extended-join CAP capability

Eggdrop v1.9.1:

  General changes:
    - Fixed an issue where an IP address was incorrectly overwritten after a
      CTCP chat was received
    - Fixed an issue where Eggdrop would occassionally crash if no port was
      provided when the server was added
    - Error, instead of silently change, when adding a bot with invalid ascii
      characters in the handle (.+bot)
    - Removed an incorrect error message after restarting the bot with the
      PBKDF2 module loaded
    - Further improved error reporting for socket connections

  Botnet changes:
    - None

  Tcl API changes:
    - Fixed the isaway command to properly track AWAY server messages

  Module changes:
    - None

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - Added Libera Chat to the accepted server types
_________________________________________________________________

Eggdrop v1.9.0:

  General changes:
    - Fixed an issue where adding a server without a port could create a
      condition where Eggdrop would crash on startup
    - Fixed a bad merge in 1.9.0 that resulted in away status not being
      properly tracked by Eggdrop
    - Fixed/clarified some of the terrible error messages we've all come to
      know and love for socket connections

  Botnet changes:
    - None

  Tcl API changes:
    - None

  Module changes:
    - Fixed a bug in the CTCP module that resulted in an IP in the socket table
      being incorrectly overwritten, causing trouble with future CTCP chat
      requests. This was also prevents some Eggdrop's from incorrectly throwing
      a Tcl error during a rehash
    - Fixed an error message that incorrectly appeared after a restart when
      using the PBKDF2 module

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - None
