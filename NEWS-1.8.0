  What's new? First, read the following documents:

    INSTALL
    README
    doc/TLS
    doc/IPV6
    doc/Changes1.8
    doc/tcl-commands.doc

  All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes to
  Eggdrop in version 1.8.x. All files, with the exception of Changes1.8, are
  also available in html format in doc/html/.

  For support, feel free to visit us on Freenode #eggdrop.

  A lot of things have changed in this version, so at a minimum, read the
  Changes1.8 text file. Changes shows what's been added and fixed along the
  way.

  If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:

    1. Before you start the bot for the first time, BACKUP your userfile.

    2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!

Changes made to Eggdrop 1.8.x from Eggdrop1.6.x:

  MODULES

    All 3rd modules that work with Eggdrop1.6.x also work with Eggdrop1.8.x,
    but most of them contain a static version check for 1.6.x.
    We provide a modified version, with just that version check removed,
    for the most popular 3rd party modules at
    ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/

  SCRIPTS

    All 3rd party Tcl scripts that work with Eggdrop1.6.x fully work with
    Eggdrop1.8.x.

  ENCODINGS

    Eggdrop1.8 has been modified to support the utf-8 encoding with a fallback
    of iso8859-1. Other single-byte encodings are not yet supported, but
    full support for them is planned for a later version of Eggdrop1.8.

  IPV6

    Full IPv6 support for servers, telnet and script connections, dcc and
    botnet. See doc/IPV6 for more information.


  SSL

    Full SSL support has been added for all kinds of connections, including
    certificate verification and authorization, and partyline SSL. See doc/TLS.

  BOTNET

    Because 1.8 bots attempt to link with SSL if available everytime, make
    sure you generate a certificate on your hub bot with "make sslcert" after
    "make install".

  CONFIG

     eggdrop.conf changes

     For the transition from Eggdrop1.6.x to Eggdrop1.8, we provide a list
     of modifications in the default config, which are only few settings,
     at http://eggheads.org/eggconf180.txt

     my-ip/my-hostname

     The two settings my-ip and my-hostname have been removed and replaced by
     vhost4, vhost6 and the listen-addr setting.
     Check our new eggdrop.conf for examples.

     eggdrop-basic.conf

     Eggdrop1.8.0 includes an easier configuration file called
     eggdrop-basic.conf recommended for users that do not need advanced
     Eggdrop features such as botnets. We still recommend reading the full
     eggdrop.conf and copying settings over that you might want to modify.


  WIRE REMOVED

    The wire module has been removed from eggdrop 1.8. You can still get it
    from ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/wire-2.1.tar.gz
    Note that with ssl support you can have encrypted botnet and partyline
    without wire.mod.


  DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation has been updated to reflect new and removed commands and
    variables. Almost all files have changed, so take a look at them.


  TCL COMMANDS

    A lot of changes have been made to Tcl commands. Please look at
    doc/tcl-commands.doc to see them. New or changed commands are marked with
    vertical bars (|) on the left.
